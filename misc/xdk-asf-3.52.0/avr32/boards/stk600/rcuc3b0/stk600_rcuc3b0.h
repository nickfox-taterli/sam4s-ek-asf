 *
 * This file contains definitions and services related to the features of the
 * STK600 board with RCUC3B0 routing card. As the STK600 Leds, switches, clocks are configurable
 * through connectors and software through Atmel Studio, the proposed definitions
 * below should be considered as examples and may be modified for a given application.
 *
 * To use this board, define BOARD=STK600_UC3B0.
